### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
We use **Python** to understand Bikeshare data for Chicago, New York and Washington. We have created an **interactive environment** where the user can select filters to analyze the data set. Statistics are calculated based on these filters. 

The user can choose between cities and filter by month, day or not at all. Depending on the answer, the user is asked to specify the month or day. 

**Statistics on the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trips, on the total and average trip duration and on bikeshare users are displayed.** 

### Files used
The data comes from three csv files, one for each city (Chicago, New York, Washington). All three of the data files contain six columns with start time, end time, trip duration, start station, end station and user type. The Chicago and New York City files have the additional columns Gender and Birth Year.

Depending on the selected city, the data will be loaded. 

We have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda as well as a text editor.
